## 2026-03-18 — code-mapper — Tasks #7 + #8: Entity Management API + UI
**Outcome:** COMPLETED
**Summary:** Updated CODE_MAP.md with all new server and client modules from Tasks #7 and #8: FileManager singleton, frontmatter utils (parseFrontmatter, serializeFrontmatter, filePathToId), three new API route files (agents, skills, claudemd), and four new client components (AgentEditor, SkillEditor, ClaudeMdEditor, EntitiesView) plus useApi.js extensions (apiPut, apiDeleteWithBody). Appended Task #7 and #8 entries to CHANGELOG.md. Fixed PROGRESS.md placement of Task #8.
**Files changed:** docs/memory/CODE_MAP.md (rewritten), docs/memory/CHANGELOG.md (appended), docs/memory/PROGRESS.md (Task #8 moved to Completed), docs/memory/agents/code-mapper.md (created)
**Bugs fixed:** PROGRESS.md had Task #8 misplaced in Pending section — moved to Completed
**Decisions made:** Documented resolveAllowedBase as two separate entries (agents.js scopes to USER_AGENTS_DIR; skills.js scopes to USER_CLAUDE_DIR) — different coverage is a security-relevant distinction
**Blockers:** none
**Next:** Tasks #9 (Job Mode API) and #10 (Job Mode UI) — code-mapper should document JobRunner, SSE route, JobPanel after completion

## 2026-03-18 — backend-dev — Task #7: Entity Management API — Agents, Skills, CLAUDE.md
**Outcome:** COMPLETED
**Summary:** Implemented the full entity management REST API. Created the missing FileManager.js prerequisite, a shared frontmatter utility module, and three new route files (agents, skills, claudemd). Mounted all three routers in server/index.js. npm run build and node --check on all new files passed with no errors.
**Files changed:** server/services/FileManager.js (CREATED), server/utils/frontmatter.js (CREATED), server/routes/agents.js (CREATED), server/routes/skills.js (CREATED), server/routes/claudemd.js (CREATED), server/index.js (MODIFIED)
**Bugs fixed:** FileManager.js was never created in Task #5 despite being in the spec — created here as first step
**Decisions made:** Shared frontmatter utils in server/utils/ to avoid duplication; resolveAllowedBase() validates filePath against all registered project paths before any write
**Blockers:** none
**Next:** Task #8 (frontend-dev) — AgentEditor, SkillEditor, ClaudeMdEditor React components
---
## 2026-03-18 — frontend-dev — Task #8: Entity Management UI — AgentEditor, SkillEditor, ClaudeMdEditor
**Outcome:** COMPLETED
**Summary:** Implemented the full entity management UI in React. Created three editor components (AgentEditor, SkillEditor, ClaudeMdEditor) and updated EntitiesView to render them via a tab bar. All components connect to the backend APIs with proper CSRF headers, display loading/error states, and handle form validation. Build verified clean (49 modules, no errors).
**Files changed:** client/src/hooks/useApi.js (apiPut + apiDeleteWithBody added), client/src/components/AgentEditor.jsx (CREATED), client/src/components/SkillEditor.jsx (CREATED), client/src/components/ClaudeMdEditor.jsx (CREATED), client/src/views/EntitiesView.jsx (replaced stub)
**Bugs fixed:** apiPut and apiDeleteWithBody were missing from useApi.js
**Decisions made:** Non-auto-dismiss restart banner for agents per spec; auto-dismiss 3s toast for skills; live (not debounced) line count in ClaudeMdEditor
**Blockers:** none
**Next:** Task #9 (Job Mode API — backend-dev) + Task #10 (Job Mode UI — frontend-dev)
---
## 2026-03-18 — project-manager — Project Analysis: Status Review + Task Plan Update
**Outcome:** COMPLETED
**Summary:** Discovered that Tasks #3-#6 were all committed to git but the TASK_PLAN.md still showed them as IN_PROGRESS or PENDING. Updated all 4 task statuses to COMPLETED. Identified that FileManager.js was not created in Task #5 despite being in the spec — this is a gap that Task #7 must fill. Project is now entering Phase 2 (Entity Management) and Phase 3 (Job Mode) simultaneously.
**Files changed:** docs/TASK_PLAN.md, docs/memory/PROGRESS.md, docs/memory/agents/project-manager.md, docs/memory/ACTIVITY_LOG.md
**Bugs fixed:** Stale task statuses in TASK_PLAN.md (Tasks #3, #4, #5, #6 were not marked COMPLETED)
**Decisions made:** Tasks #7 and #9 are parallelizable; Task #11 is also parallelizable with them
**Blockers:** FileManager.js missing from server/services/ — Task #7 agent must create it
**Next:** Assign Task #7 (backend-dev) + Task #9 (backend-dev) + Task #11 (frontend-dev) in parallel

## 2026-03-18 — frontend-dev — Task #6: Frontend Sidebar + TerminalView
**Outcome:** COMPLETED
**Summary:** Built the full React SPA shell including AppContext (global state), useSession hook (WebSocket lifecycle + reconnect), xterm.js Terminal component (ResizeObserver + FitAddon), Sidebar with project management and session status indicators, AddProjectModal, and TerminalView with Start Terminal flow and ring buffer replay. Build verified.
**Files changed:** client/src/store/AppContext.jsx, client/src/hooks/useSession.js, client/src/components/Terminal.jsx, client/src/components/Sidebar.jsx, client/src/components/AddProjectModal.jsx, client/src/views/TerminalView.jsx
**Bugs fixed:** none listed
**Decisions made:** xterm.js term.reset() called on session switch to clear old output; ResizeObserver debounced 100ms
**Blockers:** none
**Next:** Task #7 (Entity Management API) + Task #9 (Job Mode API) + Task #11 (Projects View)
---

## 2026-03-18 — backend-dev — Task #5: SessionManager + WebSocket terminal handler
**Outcome:** COMPLETED
**Summary:** Implemented RingBuffer (100KB circular buffer), SessionManager (singleton PTY owner with permanent pty.onData handler, idle sweeper, backpressure guard), session REST routes, and WebSocket terminalHandler. PTY survives browser tab close. tree-kill used for process cleanup.
**Files changed:** server/services/RingBuffer.js, server/services/SessionManager.js, server/routes/sessions.js, server/ws/terminalHandler.js, server/index.js
**Bugs fixed:** ConPTY deadlock mitigated via permanent pty.onData pattern
**Decisions made:** tree-kill via createRequire (CJS module interop); sessionManager.claudeBin set by index.js at startup
**Blockers:** none — NOTE: FileManager.js (Part E of spec) was NOT created
**Next:** Task #6 (frontend), Task #7 (entity API needs FileManager)
---

## 2026-03-18 — backend-dev — Task #4: Project Management REST API
**Outcome:** COMPLETED
**Summary:** Implemented all project CRUD endpoints (GET/POST/DELETE /api/v1/projects and POST /api/v1/projects/scaffold). Scaffold creates .claude/CLAUDE.md, .claude/agents/, .claude/commands/. All endpoints verified.
**Files changed:** server/routes/projects.js, server/index.js
**Bugs fixed:** none
**Decisions made:** scaffold creates minimal .claude/ structure including agents and commands subdirectories
**Blockers:** none
**Next:** Task #5 (SessionManager)
---

## 2026-03-18 — backend-dev — Task #3: Server Foundation
**Outcome:** COMPLETED
**Summary:** Bootstrapped server/index.js with helmet, CSRF middleware, ConfigStore, ProcessRegistry, BinaryDiscovery, SIGTERM/SIGINT handlers, 127.0.0.1 binding. GET /health returns 200.
**Files changed:** server/index.js, server/services/ConfigStore.js, server/services/ProcessRegistry.js, server/services/BinaryDiscovery.js, server/services/index.js, server/middleware/security.js, server/middleware/csrf.js, server/middleware/pathValidation.js
**Bugs fixed:** none
**Decisions made:** package corrections: write-file-atomic (not write-atomic), node-pty (not node-pty-prebuilt-multiarch)
**Blockers:** none
**Next:** Task #4 (Project API)
---

## 2026-03-18 — architect + devops — Tasks #1 + #2: Architecture + Monorepo Scaffold
**Outcome:** COMPLETED
**Summary:** Produced docs/ARCHITECTURE.md (10 sections complete) and set up the full monorepo with npm start verified at 127.0.0.1:3000. Discovered package corrections: node-pty instead of prebuilt-multiarch, write-file-atomic instead of write-atomic.
**Files changed:** docs/ARCHITECTURE.md, package.json, server/package.json, client/package.json, client/vite.config.js, client/src/main.jsx, client/src/App.jsx, server/index.js (stub)
**Bugs fixed:** Package name corrections for node-pty and write-atomic
**Decisions made:** All major architectural decisions documented in DECISIONS.md (DEC-001 through DEC-010)
**Blockers:** none
**Next:** Task #3 (Server Foundation)
